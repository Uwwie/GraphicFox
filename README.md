Swing Console / Graphic game : Fox quest.
Example of my work with Swing and sound (native java). Supports save / start new game / create account. The app blinks slightly but this is the cost of an app , able to generate any graphical text quest with given information from a db. Direct coding could prevent blinking, but my goal was to generate a graphical Swing program, able to make ANY quest from txt data.
